# ArChat

# Overview
*Archat* is a project that enables reading and posting comments on any website on the internet by using extension that connects with
*ArConnect Wallet* and enables user to both write and read comments about basically any page.

## Inspiration
ArChat, a browser extension, was born from the inspiration to create a decentralized and privacy-focused social interaction platform. The growing concerns surrounding data privacy and centralized control in mainstream social media platforms motivated the development of ArChat. Leveraging the power of Web3 technologies, ArConnect wallet, and arweave's permanent data storage, ArChat sought to offer users a seamless and secure experience, where they could connect and communicate without compromising their privacy.

## What it does
At its core, ArChat is a revolutionary browser extension that empowers users to engage in decentralized and encrypted conversations through posts and comments. The extension facilitates the creation of public posts and the receipt of comments, which are securely and immutably stored on the arweave blockchain. The seamless integration with ArConnect wallet ensures a user-friendly and secure authentication process, giving users complete control over their identities and data. ArChat represents a new era of social media interactions, prioritizing privacy, data ownership, and freedom of expression.

## How we built it
The development of ArChat as a browser extension involved skillfully utilizing TypeScript  to design and implement the user interface. Web3 libraries and frameworks were instrumental in seamlessly interacting with the Arweave blockchain and ArConnect wallet. Building a fully functional and user-friendly extension within the browser environment required overcoming unique challenges and complexities associated with browser extension development.

## Challenges we ran into
Throughout the development of ArChat, several challenges emerged that needed to be addressed. Integrating Web3 technologies and ensuring secure user authentication presented some of the initial hurdles. Additionally, optimizing the extension's performance and addressing scalability concerns within the browser environment required innovative solutions. However, with dedication and perseverance, these challenges were overcome, resulting in a robust and user-centric browser extension.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The journey of creating ArChat as a browser extension is a source of immense pride. Successfully building a fully functional and decentralized social media platform within the browser environment was a significant accomplishment. The seamless integration with ArConnect wallet and arweave blockchain showcased the commitment to providing users with a secure and user-centric experience. ArChat represents a step towards empowering users with greater control over their data and privacy within the realm of social media.
